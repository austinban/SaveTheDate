# Save the Date project for Harbour

## Description
This app is meant to allow you to upload a DOCX file and extract the dates from it. It will then allow you to display them in a calendar. At least if everything works as planned...

This is my first time building in Vue, so I am positive there is room for improvement. This was largely an exploratory exercise to help get me familiar with the framework.
